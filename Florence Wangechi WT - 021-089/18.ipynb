    "and the effectiveness of aid in different countries. We will use two of their datasets, which\n",
    "you can see online by following the links below. You do not need to download the\n",
    "datasets.\n",

    "One dataset lists the `gross domestic product (GDP)` for each country, in United States\n",

    "life expectancy data I can access is for 2013, so that will be the year we will take for the `GDP`.\n",
    "The disadvantage of using the `GDP` and the `life expectancy` values for the same year is\n",
