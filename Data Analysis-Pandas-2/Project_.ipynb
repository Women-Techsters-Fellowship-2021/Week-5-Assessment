    "# Project :  Holiday weather\n",

    "There is nothing I like better than taking a holiday. In this project I am going to use the historic weather data from the Weather Underground for London to try to predict two good weather weeks to take off as holiday. Of course the weather in the summer of 2016 may be very different to 2014 but it should give some indication of when would be a good time to take a summer break.\n",

    "## Getting the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Weather Underground keeps historical weather data collected in many airports around the world. Right-click on the following URL and choose 'Open Link in New Window' (or similar, depending on your browser):\n",
    "\n",
    "http://www.wunderground.com/history\n",
    "\n",
    "When the new page opens start typing 'LHR' in the 'Location' input box and when the pop up menu comes up with the option 'LHR, United Kingdom' select it and then click on 'Submit'. \n",
    "\n",
    "When the next page opens with London Heathrow data, click on the 'Custom' tab and select the time period From: 1 January 2014 to: 31 December 2014 and then click on 'Get History'. The data for that year should then be displayed further down the page. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can copy each month's data directly from the browser to a text editor like Notepad or TextEdit, to obtain a single file with as many months as you wish.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weather Underground has changed in the past the way it provides data and may do so again in the future. \n",
    "I have therefore collated the whole 2014 data in the provided 'London_2014.csv' file which can be found in the project folder. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now load the CSV file into a dataframe making sure that any extra spaces are skipped:"

Of course this is no guarantee that the weather pattern will repeat itself in future years. To make a sensible prediction we would need to analyse the summers for many more years. By the time you have finished this course you should be able to do that."
