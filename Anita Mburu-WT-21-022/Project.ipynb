    "\n",
    "The milk and cream trade of the UK from January to May 2015 was analysed in terms of which countries the UK mostly depends on for income (exports) and goods (imports). Over the period, the UK had a trade surplus of over 100 million US dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ireland is the main partner, but it imported from the UK almost the triple in value than it exported to the UK. \n",
    "\n",
    "The UK exported to over 100 countries during the period, but only imported from 21 countries, the main ones (top five by trade value) being geographically close. China and Hong Kong are the main importers that are not also main exporters. \n",
    "\n",
    "The UK is heavily dependent on its regular customers, the 16 countries that buy all types of milk and cream every month. They contribute three quarters of the total export value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The UK has bi-directional trade (i.e. both exports and imports) with 20 countries, although for some the trade value (in US dollars) is suspiciously low, which raises questions about the data's accuracy.\n",
